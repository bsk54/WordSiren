New vocabulary trainer aims to improve language learning

Date: 4 November 2024

Word Siren, a new vocabulary learning application, is designed to help individuals manage their vocabulary lists and effectively track their learning progress.

At the heart of the application is a word management system that allows users to easily add, edit and delete vocabulary entries.

A notable feature of the application is its testing functionality, where users can engage in self-assessment sessions to recall vocabulary items. Immediate feedback is provided on performance, with correct and incorrect answers tracked to help users focus on areas that need more attention. 

The system is designed for use on computers, not mobile devices. An overview of the extensive list of shortcuts for which no keys are available will be published shortly.
